01_Experiment
=============

Loading ".dae"-SketchUp-model (colored cube) in WebGL supported browser with scaling and rotating functions using Three.js

This project is an academic experiment. The aim is clear and below. All codes are provided by Mr.doob. Thank you for Three.js very much. Furthermore thank you Pepino and Peter Asmus for the very helpful tutorials.

Two weeks ago, I wanted to start the practical "coding-work", which is "the proof of concept" of an academic paper. The theoretical concept was developed over a very long time. With Three.js and together with all the tutorials, I can put the basics of project into action.
